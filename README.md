Replicate a picture with 50 convex polygons.

There are two examples in the main class. Those represent two differents ways to copy the picture. 
The first one is classic genetic algorithm.
The second one idea is to start with one polygon, find the best copy using genetic algorithm and add a new polygon.

**To Run the code :**

* clone the repository 
* change the path of the picture you want copy in the Main class
* compile the main class
* run the code


**BEWARE** : you need javafx to run the code
